				<h3>Age Diversity</h3>
				<p>Trees have a few stages of life them being</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong class="newMaturity">New Trees</strong> who were very recently planted.</li>
					<li><strong class="juvenileMaturity">Juvenile Trees</strong> who are young trees that were recently
						planted in the last few years.</li>
					<li><strong class="semiMatureMaturity">Semi-mature Trees</strong> who are trees that are no longer
						young however have not fully matured.</li>
					<li><strong class="matureMaturity">Mature Trees</strong> who are trees that have fully matured.</li>
					<li><strong class="overMatureMaturity">Over-mature Trees</strong> who are trees that have gone pass
						the mature stage and begun to die.</li>
					<li><strong class="unknownMaturity">Unknown Maturity Trees</strong> who are trees with unknown
						maturities.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>As trees get older and become <strong class="overMatureMaturity">over-mature</strong> they must be
					removed
					to allow <strong class="newMaturity">new trees</strong> to be planted and grow. However as many of
					the trees in Melbourne were planted at the
					same time they must all be removed at the same time. Hence it is important to have many trees with a
					vareity of ages.</p>
				<br><br><br>
				<h3>Species Diversity</h3>
				<p>Having a wide variety of trees is also important as it can allow for increased strength against
					pests, diseases and stress.<br><br>
					Unfortunately the trees planted in Melbourne are dominated by Eucalyptus, Acacias, Ulmus (Elms) and
					Platanus (Planes).<br><br>
					As mentioned before with many of the trees being planted at similar times many of the <strong
						class="matureMaturity">mature trees</strong>
					are reaching the end of their life and becoming <strong
						class="overMatureMaturity">over-mature</strong> hence it is important to have a vareity of
					types.</p>

		<h2>Significant Trees in the city of Yarra</h2>

				<h3>Significant Trees Program in Yarra</h3>
				<p>Within the city of Yarra there is a program that allows anyone to nominate
					a tree to be put on the significant tree register. These trees are in various places such as
					<strong class="parkLocation">parks,</strong><strong class="streetLocation"> streets,</strong>
					<strong class="residentialLocation"> residential areas,</strong>
					<strong class="industrialLocation"> industrial areas</strong> and <strong
						class="otherLocation">other locations.</strong><br><br>
					These trees may be classified as significant for many reasons such as having an impressive size,
					age, rarity or even ecological or cultural signficance.<br><br>
					This registery of significant trees allows the council to easily identify trees that has some sort
					of additional value. This helps when planning, managing and conversving the nature in the city.
					It also allows for the community to become more aware and appreciative of these significant trees
					that are all around them.
				</p>

				<h3>Significant Tree Diversity</h3>
				<p>Unfortunately it seems that most of the significant trees in the city of Yarra suffer from the same problem that being majority are <strong
					class="matureMaturity">mature</strong> Eucalyptus and Ulmus (Elms). However this is understandable as due to the fact that these types of trees tend to grow faster than the others.</p>
